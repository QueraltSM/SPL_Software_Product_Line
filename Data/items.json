    "description": "Before The Matrix, before Star Wars, before Ender's Game and Neuromancer, there was Dune: winner of the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards, and widely considered one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written.\r\n\r\nMelange, or 'spice', is the most valuable - and rarest - element in the universe; a drug that does everything from increasing a person's life-span to making interstellar travel possible. And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world Arrakis.\r\n\r\nWhoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. And whoever controls the spice controls the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor transfers stewardship of Arrakis from the noble House Harkonnen to House Atreides, the Harkonnens fight back, murdering Duke Leto Atreides. Paul, his son, and Lady Jessica, his concubine, flee into the desert. On the point of death, they are rescued by a band for Fremen, the native people of Arrakis, who control Arrakis' second great resource: the giant worms that burrow beneath the burning desert sands.\r\n\r\nIn order to avenge his father and retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens, Paul must earn the trust of the Fremen and lead a tiny army against the innumerable forces aligned against them. And his journey will change the universe.\r\n\r\nPublisher: Hodder & Stoughton\r\nISBN: 9780340960196\r\nNumber of pages: 592\r\nWeight: 408 g\r\nDimensions: 196 x 128 x 42 mm",

    "description": "Hidden in Jimbocho, Tokyo is a booklover's paradise.\r\n\r\nOn a quiet corner in an old wooden building lies a shop filled with hundreds of second-hand books. Twenty-five-year-old Takako has never liked reading, although the Morisaki bookshop has been in her family for three generations.\r\n\r\nIt is the pride and joy of her uncle Satoru, who has devoted his life to the bookshop since his wife Momoko left him five years earlier. When Takako's boyfriend reveals he's marrying someone else, she reluctantly accepts her eccentric uncle's offer to live rent-free in the tiny room above the shop.\r\n\r\nHoping to nurse her broken heart in peace, Takako is surprised to encounter new worlds within the stacks of books lining the Morisaki bookshop. As summer fades to autumn, Satoru and Takako discover they have more in common than they first thought.\r\n\r\nThe Morisaki bookshop has something to teach them both about life, love, and the healing power of books.\r\n\r\nPublisher: Bonnier Books Ltd\r\nISBN: 9781786583239\r\nNumber of pages: 160\r\nWeight: 157 g\r\nDimensions: 198 x 129 x 13 mm",

    "description": "Taking the radical performance Zerreißprobe (Stress Test) by Günter Brus as its point of departure, the Neue Nationalgalerie shows how dramatically post-war art was shaped by the tensions that existed between politics and society.\r\n\r\nThe presentation features key works from West and East Germany, Western Europe and the USA, and unpacks central artistic and societal themes from the 20th century, such as issues related to realism and abstraction, politics and society, everyday life and pop culture, feminism or nature and ecology.\r\n\r\nOn display are works from the Art Informel movement and American Colour Field painting, from Pop Art and Minimalism, as well as the Conceptual Art of figures such as Josef Albers, Joseph Beuys, Francis Bacon, Lee Bontecou, Rebecca Horn, Valie Export, Bruce Naumann, Wolfgang Mattheuer, Louise Nevelson, Gerhard Richter, Bridget Riley or Willi Sitte.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will also spotlight a number of works and artists that have recently been added into the collection.\r\n\r\nCurated by Joachim Jäger, Marta Smolińska and Maike Steinkamp\r\n\r\nA special exhibition by the Nationalgalerie – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\nPrice info: Richter / Reigl. special exhibitions lower level\r\n\r\nPrice: €8.00\r\n\r\nReduced price: €4.00\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nNeue Nationalgalerie\r\nPotsdamer Straße 50\r\n10785  Berlin",

    "description": "Every three years the Bruges Triennial brings contemporary art and architecture to the historic city centre of Bruges: a unique setting and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since 2015 the Bruges Triennial has built further on the series of triennials that were put together in 1968, 1971 and 1974 and brought visual arts into the public domain.\r\n\r\nIn each edition, the artistic team invites national and international artists and architects to submit new temporary installations. Some dozen of these works of art engage in an active dialogue with their surroundings, waterways, cobbled streets, Bruges houses and unused land or buildings. For visitors, it is a free exploration, following a unique and inviting trail with a social aspect.\r\n\r\nThe Bruges Triennial is an initiative of Brugge Plus NPO, commissioned by the City of Bruges, in collaboration with cultural partners Cultuurcentrum Brugge, De Republiek, Het Entrepot and Musea Brugge.",
